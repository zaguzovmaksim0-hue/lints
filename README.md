This Java package is a collection of "lints" (aka "checkers") for
[XMIR] (an intermediate representation of a
[EO] object). This is primarily about best practices and readiness
of code for successful compilation and execution, not about code
formatting. A few lints also enforce naming conventions, since
consistent naming is considered a best practice here too.

We use this package as a dependency in the
[EO-to-Java compiler][EO]:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.eolang</groupId>
  <artifactId>lints</artifactId>
  <version>0.4.9</version>
</dependency>
```

You can also use it in order to validate the validity
of [XMIR] documents your software may generate:

```java
import com.jcabi.xml.StrictXML;
import org.eolang.lints.Source;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

final class Foo {
    @Test
    void testValidSource() {
        Assertions.assertTrue(
            new Source(
                new StrictXML("<object> your XMIR goes here </object>")
            ).defects().isEmpty()
        );
    }
}
```

It is possible to disable any particular linter in a program,
with the help of the `+unlint` meta.

Whole-program analysis (running lints across a set of XMIR files
instead of one at a time) lives in a separate package,
[`org.eolang:wpa`](https://github.com/objectionary/wpa).

## Running Locally on a `.eo` File

There is no standalone CLI in this repository, but you can lint
a single `.eo` file with a few lines of Java. Besides `lints`,
add [`eo-parser`](https://github.com/objectionary/eo), which turns
EO source into [XMIR]:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.eolang</groupId>
  <artifactId>eo-parser</artifactId>
  <!-- keep this in sync with "home.version" in this project's pom.xml -->
  <version>0.4.9</version>
</dependency>
```

```java
import com.jcabi.xml.XML;
import java.nio.file.Paths;
import org.cactoos.io.InputOf;
import org.eolang.lints.Source;
import org.eolang.parser.EoSyntax;

final class RunLints {
    public static void main(final String... args) throws Exception {
        final XML xmir = new EoSyntax(
            new InputOf(Paths.get("my-program.eo"))
        ).parsed();
        new Source(xmir).defects().forEach(System.out::println);
    }
}
```

Each printed defect includes the source line, e.g.
`[mandatory-spdx/S WARNING]:1 The +spdx meta is mandatory, but is absent`.
Print `xmir` itself to inspect the parsed object tree, the `<errors>`
parser diagnostics, and the original `<listing>`, which helps when a
lint isn't behaving as expected.

## Design of This Library

The library is designed as a set of lints, each of which
is a separate class implementing the `Lint` interface.
Each lint is responsible for checking one particular aspect
of the [XMIR] document. The `Source` class is responsible for
running all lints and collecting defects for a single XMIR file.
All in all, there are only three classes and interfaces that
are supposed to be exposed to a user of the library:

* `Source` - checker of a single [XMIR]
* `Defect` - a single defect discovered
* `Severity` - a severity of a defect

There are also a few classes that implement `Iterable<Lint>`:
`PkMono` and `PkByXsl`.
They are supposed to be used only by the `Source`,
and are not supposed to be exposed to the user of the library.
They are responsible for providing a set of lints to be executed,
building them from the information in classpath.

Fork repository, make changes, then send us
a [pull request](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/15/github-guidelines.html).
We will review your changes and apply them to the `master` branch shortly,
provided they don't violate our quality standards. To avoid frustration,
before sending us your pull request please run full Maven build:

```bash
mvn clean install -Pqulice
```

Also, run this and make sure your changes don't slow us down:

```bash
mvn jmh:benchmark
```

You will need [Maven 3.3+](https://maven.apache.org) and Java 11+ installed.
Also, if you have [xcop](https://github.com/yegor256/xcop) installed, make sure
it is version `0.8.0`+.
If you want the code to be checked using
[error-prone](https://errorprone.info/), use Java 17+
If you want to check [markdown files](src/main/resources/org/eolang/motives)
using [vale](https://vale.sh/docs/install),
just install it and make sure it's in your `PATH`
